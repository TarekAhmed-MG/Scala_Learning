  // ToDo: scala method notation and method naming

  // ToDo: Operators in Scala are actually Methods

  // this is equivalent to:
  val anotherBasicMath = 1.+(2) // this is the same as you would do object.method() so int.+(int) ==> int + int

  // so all the operators we use day to day are all methods

  * example below:
  *  */

  // the presense of an apply method in a class allows intances of that class to be called in this way:

  // when you call the object like this MySingleton(19) the compiler automatically interprets this as a call to the apply method
  // this is used in functional programming, the apply method allows instances of a class to be invoked like functions


  // ToDo: companion objects
  /*
  * this is where the object/trait has the same name as the class
  * companions can access each others private fields/methods but the instances of animals are different to the singleton animal
  * you would use the companion object (singleton) to access things that do not depend on the companion class.
    - it allows for encapsulation: where you can keep related code together where instance-specific data can be shared as methods and utilities in the companion object
    - can place all the factory methods in there for cleaner and more readable code
    - allows for shared functionality by holding methods and values that should be shared across all instances - making them act like static methods for example in java

  // ToDo: Case Classes

  /*
  * Case classes are lightweight data structures with some boilerplate
  - sensible equals and hash code
  - sensivle and quick serialization
  - companion with apply
  - pattern matching (will discuss later)

  // but with case classes you can omit the new
  // because each case class has an apply and you can instantiate the class using the apply method

  val michael = Person("Michael", 27) // this is equivalent to Person.apply("Michael",27)

  // ToDo: exceptions

  // this is the normal structured try catch you would find in for example java ( the java version of catch being catch(Exception e) {....})
  try{
    // can write code  that can thow
    val x: String = null
    println(x.length)

  }

  // ToDo: Generics

  abstract class MyList[T] { //my list is applicable for any type denoted T (this also works for classes and traits)
    def head: T // which will return the element of type T
    def tail: MyList[T] // the tail will return the list of type T
  }
  // insde the class you can have defenitions that depend on the type T so you can use it as defenitions so when you use it later the T becomes concrete

  // using generics with a concrete type
  val aList: List[Int] = List(1,2,3) // List.apply(1,2,3)
  val first = aList.head // this now becomes concrete as the T becomes an Int as we defined aList as a List[Int] type
  val rest = aList.tail
  val aStringList = List("hello","Scala")
  val firstString = aStringList.head // will return String hello

  //TODO: IMPORTANT INFORMATION

  /*
  * TODO: Point #1: In Scala we usually operate with IMMUTABLE values/objects
  * Any Modifications to an object MUST return ANOTHER object
  * so in the example below it would give you a new object so you dont mutate or change the values of the original object
    - Benefits:
      1) excellent for multithreading/distributed environments -why?
      2) helps makes sense of the code("reasoning about")
  * */

  /*
  * TODO: Point #2: Scala is the closes to the Object Oriented Ideal even though it can be used for both OOP and Functional
  * it is a true OO language
  * */
  val reversedList = aList.reverse // returns a NEW list

  // TODO: Look into this a bit more its such as use cases to get a better understanding of the whole picture
      // my main question is that in scala do we need to create the list class or can we import collections like java
      // question when you print first you get 1 but when you print rest you get List(2,3)
      
      // it is because scala lists are like linked lists where the head will give you the first element and the tail will retrieve everything else
