  // Ordering - its a two element function which tells you which element is less than another
  // so the sorted method works because scala takes a 2 element ordering function and injects it into .sorted

  // to add our own ordering method to sorted we need to create a given instance - this will replace the normal sorted functionality

  // analogous to an implicit val - the sorted value takes an implicit value of Ordering B
