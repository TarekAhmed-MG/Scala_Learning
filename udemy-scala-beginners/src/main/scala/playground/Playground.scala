  // EXPRESSIONS VS INSTRUCTIONS:
    // Instructions are executed whereas expressions are evaluated.(think scala code blocks where the last statement is the return value as opposed to a print statement which is an instruction)

  // side effects are basically like instructions in imperative programming like Java,Python,C etc but in scala they are expressions that return unit
